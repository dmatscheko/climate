# Report: Earth’s Carbon Cycle, CO2 Dynamics, Temperature Projections, and Humanity’s Survival Probability

## Overview of Earth’s Carbon Cycle and CO2 Dynamics

Earth’s carbon cycle regulates atmospheric CO2, balancing it across the atmosphere, biosphere, oceans, and lithosphere, shaping climate over billions of years. In the early Earth (~4.5–2.4 billion years ago), CO2 levels ranged from 10,000 to 100,000 ppm, sustaining a warm climate with methane and water vapor despite a faint young Sun[^1]. Cyanobacteria, preserved in 3.5-billion-year-old Australian stromatolites, began oxygenic photosynthesis, converting CO2 into organic matter and oxygen. This triggered the Great Oxygenation Event[^2] (~2.4 billion years ago), reducing CO2 to ~1,000–10,000 ppm and collapsing methane, causing global cooling (Huronian glaciation) and mass extinction of anaerobic microbes due to oxygen toxicity. Limited decomposition buried carbon in sediments, stabilizing the cycle.

In the Carboniferous period (359–299 million years ago), CO2 fell from ~1,500 ppm to ~300–500 ppm as lignin-rich plants, like *Lepidodendron* trees, formed coal deposits in swampy forests[^3]. Lignin’s resistance to microbial decay (due to absent fungi) led to massive carbon burial, cooling the planet. By the Permian (~250 million years ago), white-rot fungi evolved, recycling lignin and stabilizing CO2 at ~200–400 ppm, though volcanic events like the Siberian Traps later spiked levels. Marine phytoplankton, forming oil in anoxic basins (e.g., North Sea oil fields), sequestered carbon as limestone and oil from ~200 million years ago, maintaining CO2 at ~200–2,000 ppm through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic[^4].

In the pre-industrial era (~1750), CO2 stabilized at ~280 ppm, balanced by forests, oceans, and silicate weathering. Since the Industrial Revolution, burning fossil fuels (e.g., coal from Carboniferous deposits, oil from Mesozoic shales) and deforestation have released ~1 trillion tons of CO2, raising levels to ~420 ppm by 2025[^5]. This unprecedented spike has driven ~1.5°C of warming, amplified by feedbacks like permafrost thaw in Siberia and methane releases from Arctic wetlands. Modern ecosystems, such as forests and soils, naturally absorb and store carbon, but natural sinks — oceans (~2–3 GtC/year), forests (~2–3 GtC/year), and weathering (~0.1–0.2 GtC/year) — are too slow to absorb the influx, leaving Earth vulnerable to prolonged warming.

## Reasoning for Temperature Increases and Probabilities

### Business-as-Usual Scenario and Drivers
The BAU scenario follows SSP5-8.5[^6], projecting CO2 levels of ~600–700 ppm by 2100 and ~1000 ppm by 2200–2300. Several factors make this high-emission pathway likely, countering optimistic scenarios like SSP2-4.5 or SSP3-7.0 (500–800 ppm by 2100):
- **AI and Cooling Energy Demands**: AI inference and data centers, powering models like those used in cloud computing, could consume 20–30% of global electricity by 2030, often reliant on coal and gas. Rising temperatures increase cooling demands (e.g., air conditioning in urban India and Europe), driving fossil fuel use.
- **Policy Rollbacks**: The United States’ elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit and 30% solar tax credit by 2025, Germany’s termination of EV subsidies and solar subsidy cuts during negative prices, Austria’s new taxes on PV systems and storage requirements, China’s phased reduction of EV and renewable subsidies, India’s slashed EV subsidies and restrictive solar net metering, and the EU’s declining renewable subsidies collectively raise costs for consumers, deter investment in electric vehicles and solar power, and lock in fossil fuel dependence (see [Policy Rollbacks](#policy-rollbacks)).
- **Economic Forcing**: Prioritizing short-term growth, as seen in coal expansion in Asia[^7], favors fossil fuels, aligning with SSP5-8.5. Fossil fuel companies’ historical denial of climate risks since the 1960s exacerbates this trend[^8].

### Temperature Projections and Methane Feedbacks
Temperature increases depend on CO2 concentrations, radiative forcing, and feedbacks, notably methane spikes from permafrost thaw, clathrates, and wetlands. Current warming (~1.5°C at 420 ppm in 2025) is the baseline. Projections use CMIP6 models (ECS 1.8–5.6°C, mean ~3.9°C), adjusted for NetCRE (Net Cloud Radiative Effect) underestimation[^9] (2.1 W/m², adding 0.6–1.7°C) and methane forcing[^10] (0.5–2.3 W/m², adding 0.15–1.8°C), yielding a methane-inclusive ECS of 2.55–8.8°C. At 1000 ppm CO2, equilibrium warming is 3.6–12.4°C.

Methane amplifies warming. Permafrost could release 50–250 GtC by 2100, with 5–15% as methane, adding ~0.1–0.5°C transient warming by 2050 and up to 1°C by 2100[^11]. For example, methane bubbling from Siberian lakes has increased emissions. Clathrates (e.g., East Siberian Arctic Shelf) and wetlands (e.g., Amazon) contribute ~0.1–0.3 W/m² and ~0.2–0.5 W/m², respectively. Unlike Eocene ECS estimates (2–5°C at 1000–2000 ppm, excluding short-term methane), modern spikes drive rapid warming on decadal scales.

### Probabilities and Impacts
The table below summarizes temperature increase probabilities under SSP5-8.5 for 2050 (~450–500 ppm), 2100 (~600–700 ppm), and 2200 (~1000 ppm), with human species survival probabilities and key impacts, derived from CMIP6 distributions[^12] and adjusted for feedbacks and policy trends. The baseline of ~1.5°C at 420 ppm in 2025 anchors near-term projections.

| Temperature (°C) | Prob. 2050 (%) | Prob. 2100 (%) | Prob. 2200 (%) | Survival Prob. (%) | Key Impacts |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 1.5–2.0          | 60             | 5              | 0              | 95–100             | Increased heatwaves (millions at risk), 6% species extinction, coral reef loss (70–90%), 20% population in high-risk zones |
| 2.0–3.0          | 35             | 30             | 5              | 70–90              | Lethal heat in tropics (35% land affected), 30–60% species extinction, 1 billion displaced, crop yield declines |
| 3.0–4.5          | 5              | 50             | 30             | 20–50              | Uninhabitable regions (100+ lethal heat days), 75% land altered, billions displaced, food production collapse |
| 4.5–6.0          | 0              | 10             | 40             | <10–20             | Equatorial regions uninhabitable, 97% species extinct, global food failure, nuclear war risks |
| 6.0–12.4         | 0              | 5              | 25             | <5–10              | Most land uninhabitable (Tw >35°C), 99% species extinct, Permian-like collapse, small refugia only |

**Reasoning for Probabilities**:
- **2050 (~450–500 ppm)**: From 1.5°C in 2025, warming of 1.8–2.5°C (median ~2.1°C) is likely[^6], with methane adding ~0.1–0.3°C. The 60% probability for 1.5–2.0°C reflects near-term constraints, while 35% for 2.0–3.0°C and 5% for 3.0–4.5°C account for feedback tail risks, driven by rapid Arctic warming.
- **2100 (~600–700 ppm)**: Median warming of ~3.5°C (range 2.5–4.5°C) dominates (50% for 3.0–4.5°C), with methane and NetCRE pushing 10% to 4.5–6.0°C and 5% to 6.0–12.4°C. Lower bins (1.5–3.0°C) are less likely due to committed warming and policy failures.
- **2200 (~1000 ppm)**: Warming shifts to 4.0–7.0°C (median ~5.5°C), with 40% for 4.5–6.0°C and 25% for 6.0–12.4°C reflecting equilibrium-like conditions and high feedbacks. Lower temperatures are improbable without mitigation.

## Survival Probability of Humanity

Human survival depends on physiological limits (wet-bulb temperature >35°C), ecosystem stability, and societal resilience. The table above details impacts and survival probabilities, derived from IPCC AR6[^6], Sherwood & Huber, 2010[^13], and Warren et al., 2018[^14], with optimism tempered by economic forcing, fossil fuel influence, and feedback uncertainties.

At 1.5–2.0°C, adaptation (e.g., cooling infrastructure in Dubai) mitigates risks, but millions in South Asia face heat stress. By 2.0–3.0°C, lethal heat and displacement strain societies, reducing survival to 70–90%. At 3.0–4.5°C, uninhabitable regions (e.g., India with 100+ days of Tw >35°C) and food collapse threaten billions, dropping survival to 20–50%. Beyond 4.5°C, equatorial uninhabitability, near-total species extinction (e.g., loss of pollinators like bees), and societal breakdown (e.g., resource wars) make survival unlikely (<10–20% at 4.5–6.0°C, <5–10% at 6.0–12.4°C). AI-driven energy demands, cooling energy demands, economic forcing, and policy rollbacks exacerbate emissions, limiting adaptation and pushing toward catastrophic outcomes.

## Conclusion

Earth’s carbon cycle, once balanced by sinks like lignin burial (reducing CO2 from 1,500 to 300 ppm) and marine sedimentation, is overwhelmed by human emissions, with CO2 rising from 280 ppm to 420 ppm and potentially 1000 ppm by 2200 under BAU. Natural sinks cannot absorb this rapid influx, and methane spikes from thawing permafrost and wetlands amplify near-term warming. Driven by AI energy demands, cooling needs, and policy reversals, SSP5-8.5 projects severe warming, with humanity’s survival probability plummeting from near-certain to <5–10% at extreme levels. Without urgent mitigation, humanity faces uninhabitable regions, ecosystem collapse, and extinction conditions, demanding immediate action to avert the darkest outcomes.
